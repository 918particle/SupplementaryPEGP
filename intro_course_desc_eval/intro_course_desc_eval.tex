I have reflected on student evaluations from the 2018-2019 introductory courses and implemented recommendations from my department and FPC.  I have also gained insight from interactions with the students and from their written responses.  I have included reflections focused on qualitative evidence from class that explain my efforts to meet the specific goals within the learning focuses defined in Sec. \ref{sec:teaching_phil1}.  Finally, I reflect on areas in which I hope to improve.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\subsection{Algebra-Based Physics Student Evaluations}

The data from 2018-2019 for the \textit{algebra-based} courses demonstrates significant teaching improvement.  Tables \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_1} and \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_2} contain data from PHYS135A/B for 2018-2019.  In Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_shifts_1}, the most \textit{recent} PHYS135 data and the \textit{first} PHYS135 course I taught are compared.  Professor Zorba was on sabbatical in Fall 2018, so I taught both sections of PHYS135A and Professor Lagan taught both sections of PHYS150.  The mean values and errors in the mean are shown for questions 10-25 on student evaluation.  Questions 10-16 pertain to the course (Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_1}), and questions 17-25 pertain to the professor (Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_2}).  A large majority of the results are statistically consistent with 4.5 out of 5.0.  I reflect on the exceptions below. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\end{table}

The data in Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_1} regarding questions 15-16 merits further discussion\footnote{Question 15: ``This course increased my interest in the subject matter.'' Question 16: ``Overall, I would recommend this course to others.''}.  One huge challenge in teaching PHYS135A/B is that students are \textit{required} to take them, but they  do not \textit{want} to take them.  Students arrive with varying degrees of math skill, and \textbf{responded to Question 9}\footnote{``I had a strong desire to take this course.''} with an average of $3.13 \pm 0.24$, $3.92 \pm 0.22$, and $3.83 \pm 0.26$.  These responses reflect student anxiety when \textit{forced} to do physics.  I have strived to address these concerns by including modules which show the students exactly how 135A/B relates to \textit{their major.} Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q15} contains the data for these questions over time. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\end{figure}

Approximately 40\% of PHYS135A/B students are KNS majors, and another 30\% are biology majors.  I have created modules focused on medical applications, and the article discussions also tie in content from their major.  The results for questions 15-16 are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro_q15}.  \textbf{The mean values over time show an unmistakable and significant improvement}.  Further, the data in Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_shifts_1} show that \textit{every student evaluation measurement has increased}, with the exception of the question pertaining to course difficulty, Question 11\footnote{``This course was academically challenging.''}.  This was partially by design, because the recommendations were to slow the pace.  However, the decrease is not statistically significant.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

In following FPC and department recommendations, I have made three modifications to PHYS135.  First, the pace has been decreased.  Second, I have included more step-by-step examples.  Third, I have included more traditional lecture content.  This was achieved without a decrease in difficulty: the most recent value for Question 11 was still $4.46 \pm 0.159$.  When I introduced these changes, some students expressed such relief that they told me in office hours.  One student joked that ``You could be an online professor for Chegg.com!'' He was complimenting my style by referencing an online resource where instructors demonstrate solutions to homework problems.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\clearpage

I have learned recently that this structure is especially helpful to foster \textbf{inclusive classrooms} \cite{inclusive}. Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q15} demonstrates measurable improvement for the first introductory course learning focus (curiosity) by \textit{measurably increasing the interest of the students in physics}.  The simple classroom pattern of 1) traditional content introducing concept 2) slow step-by-step example 3) PI module 4) laboratory activity/PhET seems to stimulate engagement and interest in the material.  Examples of student-designed experiments and presentations are included in the Supplemental Material, which also serve the first learning goal.\\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Three additional improvements came from Ch. 4 of Eric Mazur's work on PI modules \cite{mazur}.  I simplified the \textit{agenda} created just before class, ensuring it contains only 4-5 items.  I present the agenda to the students before lecture.  First, I base the agenda on the students' progress, thereby helping to find the correct pace.  Second, the simple agenda also helps to create structure and primes students for class.  As part of the agenda, I provide a list of equations used that day in the \textit{memory bank}.  Third, I remind them of current homework and reading to complete before the next class, thereby keeping them organized.  I now follow a 2018 student suggestion that I break the reading into smaller sections.  This prompts the students to focus on the 10-20 pages relevant for the next class.  An example agenda is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro:exampleAgenda} in Sec. \ref{sec:courseDesc}. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Two additional comments are relevant regarding course pace.  First, the number of textbook chapters covered in PHYS135 was not reduced.  By attending the classes taught by Profs. Zorba and Lagan, I obtained a better sense of \textit{how much} content within each chapter is covered.  Drs. Zorba and Lagan have been very helpful in demonstrating how to best set the course pace.  Professor Piner has also attended lectures in my recent classes and offered useful feedback.  Second, we removed the topics of physical oscillations from PHYS150 and thermodynamics from PHYS180.  In the past, PHYS180 was a 5.0 credit course.  We have created a new course, PHYS185, which now contains thermodynamics, oscillations, and optics.  The number of chapters for PHYS180 is now reduced by 30\%.  Thus, my department and I are working together to establish proper course pace.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The x and y-axis values of the data points are the mean values, and the errors are the errors in the mean.}
\end{figure}

My department also recommended I focus on Question 17\footnote{``The professor used class time effectively and demonstrated preparation for class''.}.  Question 17 results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro_q17}.  My department a correlation with Question 17 with other key numbers like Question 16.  Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q17} (right) shows that they are correlated.  PER modules called JITT modules I used in Spring 2018 contributed to the lower Question 17 numbers (x-value of 2 in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro_q17}, left, and x-value of 2 in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro_q14}).  JITT involves analyzing student responses to questions assigned before class, and modifying course content accordingly.  However, it was common for students to not respond rather than risk being wrong.  I reassured them that their responses are useful and that they were not being graded, but the response rates hovered around 50-60\%.  It was therefore difficult to modify content, and the students expressed strong preference for more example problems.  I have since dropped the JITT module.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\end{figure}

The second focus for introductory physics courses is to \textit{improve the analysis skill} of the students.  Our strategy appears to be working.  Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q14} contains student response data to questions 12, 14, 19, and 20\footnote{Q14: ``This course improved my understanding of the material.'' Q12: ``This course offered useful learning tools (such as lectures, discussions, readings, assignments and/or examinations).'' Q19: ``The professor was able to explain complicated ideas.'' Q20: ``The professor challenged students to think critically and/or imaginatively about the course material.''}.  The data corresponding to the second time I taught PHYS135 ($x = 2$) corresponds to the section with JITT modules, and the data falls below the trend.  I removed JITT and implemented the department and FPC-recommended changes.  \textbf{The student response data shows that their understanding of the material is improving substantially.}  One further technique I added in Fall 2019 is to give the students short, conceptual reading quizzes at the beginning of each class-period.  These ensure that the students are both primed for class and studying examples in the text.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The third focus is \textit{applications to society}, with measurable goals of requiring the students to present articles they find relevant due to societal impact and to manage and aid in student-designed experiments presented in class.  I have included examples of my students' wonderful work in this area in the Supplemental Material.  Student groups have correctly predicted rocket flight times, measured the speed of sound, and extracted DC current and voltage.  The articles the students chose were often thought-provoking, and related to their major.  My questions during their discussions steer them back to the physics involved, and the class therefore learns about the utility of physics in situations beyond the classroom.  Perhaps my favorite article example was an inspiring case study in which a University of Texas undergraduate used machine learning to help find extra-solar planets \cite{texas}. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Finally, I am thrilled to report an increase in student responses to Question 25\footnote{``Overall, I would recommend this professor to others.''}. \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q25} contains Question 25 mean values over time, and the data show an unmistakable and significant improvement.}  It turns out there has been similar improvement in the calculus-based versions of the introductory physics courses I teach.  By thoughtfully implementing the changes recommended to me by my department and FPC, I see in the data that the students are endorsing me as their professor at increasing mean values over time.  I have found upon reflecting on algebra-based physics methods, that the final piece of the puzzle was to \textit{build relationships} with the students.  What follows are anecdotal stories from class that illustrate what I was able to accomplish by building relationships with students who needed help with a difficult subject.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

My first story involves a senior KNS major.  She approached me with a question during a midterm.  The exercise required the students to write an equation and solve for $x$.  It appeared that she was on the right track, and I asked her to think conceptually about which equation is appropriate.  Eventually she chose the correct one.  I assumed she would be able to finish, given that the problem was now reduced to solving for $x$.  I will never forget her next words: ``How do I move $x$ to get it by itself ... ?''  I was completely shocked as I began to realize she was \textit{unfamiliar with the concept of algebra.}  Of course I did not blame her, but the question in my mind was: ``Who allowed this to happen?''  Knowing that this was a college senior, I resolved to get the job done.  I made it my mission to ensure that she passed my class.  Her midterm grades improved, and by the end of the course we were both pleased.  I devoted more time for her during PI discussions, and it appears to have worked.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

My second story involves a senior WSP major who was my student in PHYS135A/B.  She is an example of an excellent student who intends to apply to medical school.  As part of the new pace control I would include more group discussion time in PI modules, and I would focus my attention on tables of students I knew were struggling.  The student and her friends formed a table that almost never struggled.  I worried that my new tactics would leave students like these feeling ignored.  However, by the end of the course, she told me they had a wonderful experience!  Apparently I was able to balance my focus enough such that no one student felt left out.  She gave me a thank you card at the end of the year along with a gift card, and I was touched (See Supplemental Material).  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

My third story involves a senior Biology major.  I identified him as someone struggling with the material during my PI discussion rounds during PHYS135A and PHYS135B (2018-2019).  During our PI discussion rounds, I got the sense that he was close to get the right answers but was just short of making the vital connections necessary for word-problem solving.  I made a concerted effort to spend more time at his table, and worked quick examples for their table during discussion time.  Not only did it benefit him but it benefit the three other students because I later observed him teaching them!  After the final exam he wrote me the note below, and I eventually wrote him a letter of recommendation for an internship. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\textit{Thank you for a fun year!  Physics is hard, but I definitely learned more than I thought I would.} \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

As with the algebra-based courses, the data from the 2018-2019 academic year for the \textit{calculus-based} courses demonstrates significant improvement in my teaching.  Table \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_3} contains evaluation data from PHYS180 for 2019.  In Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_shifts_2} the student evaluation data from the \textit{first} time I taught calculus-based physics is compared to the most \textit{recent} time.  The mean values and errors in the mean are shown for evaluation questions 10-25 for both tables.  Questions 10-16 pertain to the course (Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_3}, left), and questions 17-25 pertain to the professor (Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_3}, right).  The data reflect high quality teaching and a substantial improvement compared to the first time I taught calculus-based physics. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The PHYS180 section from which the data in Tab. \ref{tab:courses:intro_eval_3} is derived shows almost perfect scores.  This is partly a credit to the changes I've put in place, and the reflecting I have done this past year.  However, it is also due to two other factors.  First, the aforementioned rearrangement of the thermodynamics curriculum made our lives easier in PHYS180.  Second, I had the chance to get acquainted with these students as advisees in the prior Fall 2018 semester before teaching them in Spring 2019.  Thus, reducing the pace of content and building relationships before class also made the course go much more smoothly. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\clearpage

The students in the PHYS180 course from 2019 were a combination of physics majors, 3-2 engineering program majors, and computer science.  I knew this particular set of students from Fall 2018, when I shadowed Dr. Lagan as he mentored them during Freshman Orientation.  By forming a relationship with them early on, I think they trusted that the class activities and methods I chose for them were for the best.  I performed my three usual changes to the course style (slower pace, more examples, and traditional content).  I followed with PI modules and laboratory activities/PhET activities.  They dived in to the PI modules with fervor, and we had many interesting discussions. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The PI module process involved just two students per table rather than 4-5 as in PHYS135.  Thus, each time I addressed a table when they hadn't gotten the answer, I was speaking with half the usual number of students.  This seemed to reduce complications and make my life easier.  When speaking with 4-5 students in algebra-based physics, I sometimes notice that the lightbulb activates in three students' minds, but one stays quiet.  Although I try to reach everyone, it is awkward when I have eight tables to approach in a limited time.  In PHYS180 (2019) I was able to target struggling students with speed and accuracy.  There were originally nine students in my section of PHYS180, but one dropped the course because he was struggling to balance varsity sports and studying.  I welcomed him to office hours to discuss his priorities, but ultimately he had to rearrange his schedule and postpone PHYS180. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q15_2} shows the evolution of student responses to questions 15-16 over time\footnote{Question 15: ``This course increased my interest in the subject matter,'' Question 16: ``Overall, I would recommend this course to others.''}.  The data show that I am perfecting my ability to boost \textbf{student curiosity} over time, in satisfaction of my first learning focus for introductory courses.  The final data point drives the trend line since it has no error.  Needless to say, I look forward to teaching PHYS150 this Fall 2019 with my new advisees.  This upcoming semester will be the first time I've been a freshman mentor and adviser to my own students. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Similar to algebra-based physics, my department asked me study Question 17\footnote{``The professor used class time effectively and demonstrated preparation for class''.}.  Data regarding Question 17 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro_q17_2}.  My department suggested that this measurement is correlated with Question 16.  Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q17_2} (right) contains data showing this correlation.  What I predict for Fall 2019 is that the data points questions 16-17 will be between 4 and 5, and that the numbers will remain correlated.  My PHYS150 section during Fall 2019 will have my advisees in it, but also it is filled to capacity (26).  To further boost responses to questions 16 and 17, I have introduced pre-lecture material in the form of reading quizzes to ensure the students begin the class on the same page.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The second of my three learning focuses for introductory physics courses is to improve the analysis skill of the students.  My strategy of combined traditional and PER based content appears to be working as I improve it over time.  Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q14_2} contains student response data to questions 14, 12, 19 and 20.  \textbf{The student response data shows that their understanding of the material is improving substantially.}  This was in part due to the aforementioned smaller class size and advisee relationships, but also due to the changes recommended by FPC and my department. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The third of my introductory learning focuses is \textit{applications to society}, and we served this goal in calculus-based physics in similar ways to algebra-based physics.  The main difference between algebra-based and calculus-based was the sophistication of the student-designed experiments.  Students designed electromagnetic lifting devices (similar to cranes that lift metal objects), and presented elloquently and in quantitative detail (see Supplemental Materials).  Students also chose articles for daily class presentation that they felt had interesting applications to business and engineering.  One student even included an example on how metallurgy is done after learning how to forge metal tools for a project outside of PHYS180. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The solid black lines are best-fit linear trend lines that minimize the $\chi^2$ value. (Right) Student responses (mean values and errors in the mean) to Questions 10-25 in all courses versus semesters taught at Whittier.  The data points from a given semester are spaced out evenly so they are individually visible.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:courses:intro_q25_2} (left) contains student response data to Question 25, from calculus-based physics versus time\footnote{``Overall, I would recommend this professor to others.''}.  \textbf{The data show an unmistakable and significant improvement.}  The trend line is driven by the final data point, and as with the other measurements, will likely fall somewhere between 4-5 for Fall 2019 PHYS150 if I continue to refine my approach to the three learning focuses for introductory physics.  To make the point of continuous improvement more clearly, I have graphed the mean value responses to \textit{all} questions on the student evaluation form versus semesters taught at Whittier College in Fig. \ref{fig:courses:intro_q25_2} (right).  The data points for each question within each semester (within $x=1,2,...$) are spread out so each is visible on the x-axis.  The general trend upwards is clear, and some courses show straight 5.0 scores.  Downward-pointing triangles represent introductory courses, and upward-pointing triangles represent 200 and 300 level courses.  The $x=3$ semester was the semester when I received and implemented FPC feedback, and the shift can be observed clearly.  The $x=4$ data corresponds to January term 2019.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

As I was learning how to serve the diverse student population at Whittier College, the results were mixed.  As time progressed, however, a general trend upwards is observed in all student response data.  There are several courses where the students gave me straight 5.0 scores.  PHYS180 (2019) was one of them, and the other two are two instances of PHYS396 (physics research for credit).  PHYS396 is a course for which we do not receive teaching credit, but is reserved for students who want to do a research project with a physics professor.  The January term of 2019 I denote as the fourth semester, in which I taught COSC390, which was a huge success (see Sec. \ref{sec:oof2}).  I am also currently advising a student in PHYS499, our senior seminar that satisfies the paper in the major requirement.  Overall, the data show that the students recognize that their learning my top priority.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}
