\epigraph{\textit{That people may know wisdom and discipline, may understand intelligent sayings; May receive instruction in wise conduct, in what is right, just and fair; That resourcefulness may be imparted to the inexperienced, knowledge and discretion to the young.} - Proverbs 1:2-5}{}

\textbf{The following is a reflection on the growth and development of my teaching practices as a professor, and is submitted upon recommendation by the Faculty Personnel Committee (FPC).}  My first two years as an assistant professor of physics were filled with valuable experiences.  I have strived to make adjustments to my classroom practices, and to follow recommendations given to me by my department and FPC.  Looking back at my first submitted teaching philosophy, I view it as a good beginning, but something that should evolve to serve the students.  In the feedback letter provided by FPC, and in the letter from my department, three general recommendations have emerged. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

First, the \textit{pace} of my content should be slowed, in order to maximize student success.  Second, I must increase the number of \textit{step-by-step example problems} in my classes, in order to give new and struggling students something concrete to grasp before moving forward.  Third, I need to include more \textit{traditional lecture content} in my integrated lecture/laboratory formatted classes.  Traditional content is a term used in physics education research (PER) to refer to the classical teaching style in which a new equation is first introduced or derived on the board, then solved in examples and displayed in graphical form.  I have strived diligently to put these changes in place, and I have shown promising results in my classes as evidenced by my increased student evaluation numbers (see Secs. \ref{sec:oof} and \ref{sec:oof2}). \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Introductory physics courses at Whittier are taught in an integrated lecture/laboratory format.  I describe the format in Sec. \ref{sec:teaching_phil1}.  I learned in my first two years that although our department recommends this format, it does not \textit{preclude} using traditional content.  In fact, what works best (we have found) is a healthy mixture.  I observe this mixture in the classes of my colleagues.  We must begin new concepts traditionally, and then branch into laboratory activities and research-based content when the students are ready.  \textit{Researched-based content} is a term in PER that refers to teaching modules that have been shown to boost student learning through controlled research.  I described three such modules in my first PEGP: Peer-instruction (PI) \cite{mazur2013peer}, Just-in-Time Teaching (JITT) \cite{jitt}, and Physics Education Technology (PhET) \cite{phet}.  I reflect in Sec. \ref{sec:teaching_phil1} on these modules' utility. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\textbf{Teaching physics is about growth}.  Regardless of the methods chosen, the student should leave class with an improved understanding of physics concepts.  Success is measured by the varying degree to which the student can retain, understand, and apply the concepts.  The goal of the professor is to formulate the concepts of physics into specific equations, testable by experimentation, and to cause the students to master the equations through problem-solving.  The student usually encounters failure, then the ability to solve specific examples.  Finally, the professor leads the students to mastery by showing them that the concepts may be applied \textit{in general} to broad classes of problems. Each stage must be accompanied by careful laboratory experiments to validate the equations. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

All physics subjects begin by defining a ``system,'' with measurable properties, like displacement, velocity, acceleration, mass, and charge.  What follows is the subject of \textit{classical physics}: a description of the motions, forces and energies that govern all systems.  With the addition of temperature and heat, \textit{thermodynamics} may be added to classical physics.  Students who do not major in physics usually encounter only classical physics.  Physics \textit{majors} progress to \textit{modern physics}, which adds the subjects of relativity and quantum mechanics to the toolkit.  We often distinguish between \textit{physics majors} and \textit{non-majors}, who encounter different types of material.  The bulk of PER is done in the context of serving non-majors, and thus the named modules (PI, JITT, and PhET) are usually applied to introductory courses.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Analogous to learning physics, learning to become a great physics instructor involves learning to impart basic concepts to the students and building upon their success.  The instructor must be able to generalize the teaching modules to lead students to more advanced topics, building the system of classical physics in their minds.  At each phase, the instructor must be able to guide laboratory experimentation, while at the same time demonstrating how the physics formulas are used to solve problems.  Upon examining my teaching, I have found the correct ``solution'' for our classical and introductory physics courses to be keeping the pace of the modules under control, including more concrete examples, and increasing the proportion of traditional lecture content.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

I have made positive strides in my advanced courses as well as my introductory courses.  It was rewarding to see warm reviews for my brand new Digital Signal Processing (COSC390) course.  Almost every student in that course wrote in their evaluations that the course should be made into a full-semester length course because they liked it so much.  I have submitted a course proposal and this course will now be regularly offered.  I am also pleased to see the course changes pay off at the introductory level in PHYS135A/B and PHYS180.  Non-majors regularly report that they \textbf{do not want to take} the algebra-based physics courses (see Sec. \ref{sec:oof}), so to hear the students report that these courses increased their interest in physics was worth the hard work I invested, and a great joy.

\subsubsection{Instruction of Students in Introductory Courses}

\label{sec:teaching_phil1}

Physics students at Whittier College are categorized as \textit{non-majors} or \textit{physics majors}.  Non-majors encounter physics for two semesters in either \textit{calculus-based} or \textit{algebra-based} courses.  Classical physics at the undergraduate introductory level is built upon single-variable calculus, with some multi-variable or vector calculus introduced in the second semester.  However, students who have not taken calculus can still learn using tools from algebra and trigonometry.  Thus, \textit{non-major} students usually take PHYS135A/B, and \textit{physics majors} and related majors take PHYS150/180.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Three focuses are relevant for teaching at the introductory level, especially to non-majors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Curiosity}.  Good teaching for non-majors should \textit{entice curiosity}, which begins by having an encounter with students where they are in their knowledge, and asking them to think more quantitatively.  I regularly give colloquia at universities, seminars in physics departments, and public lectures to children, families, and astronomical societies.  Experiencing people's curiosity is necessary to become a great instructor.  I have continued this practice as a Whittier professor.  I have given lectures at Los Nietos Middle School and colloquia here at Whittier College, and invited speakers from UC Irvine to give colloquia as well.  I continue this practice this year a Family Science Night at Granada Middle School in Spring 2020.  Within this teaching focus, I have three measurable goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Measurably increase student interest in physics as measured by questions 15 and 18 on the evaluations
\item Teach the students to satisfy curiosity through self-designed experiments and pre-designed lab activities %Labs, presentations
\item Coach the public speaking skills of the students to empower them to present results to peers %Presentations
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Improvement of Analysis Skill}.  The scientific method relies on analytical skill.  We as physicists best serve Whittier College introductory students, especially non-majors, when we develop their problem-solving abilities.  We apply PER modules in introductory courses to train students, while providing a healthy mixture of traditional lecture content and step-by-step examples.  This involves calculations as simple as converting between units (i.e. kilograms to pounds) to plotting the trajectory of a particle in a vector field.  Within this teaching focus, I seek to achieve two specific goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Measurably increase the ability of the students to obtain the correct answer in word problems (questions 12, 14, 19, and 20 on the evalutations)
\item Teach the students to measure with precision the correct result in laboratory settings 
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Applications to Society}. Whittier College students advance in their technical careers if they can qualitatively explain phenomenon using physics.  In recent years, our open-source textbooks \cite{openstax1} \cite{openstax2} have included material relevant to medicine and kinesiology. I have incorporated special units centered on these applications, including human muscle motion (in PHYS135A) and nerve systems (in PHYS135B and PHYS180).  I also help the students design experiments which can relate to their field.  One example included KNS majors in 135B who measured bicep muscle voltages for varying amounts of lifted weight.  Another tool within this learning focus is the inclusion of student-led summaries of scientific articles, which encourage class discussions about the broader implications for society.  Within this teaching focus, I seek to achieve two measurable goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Empower the students to present and discuss articles they find relevant or interesting due to the societal impact (see Supplemental Material)
\item Manage and aid in student-designed experiments that are presented to the class, relevant to society (see Supplemental Material)
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Instruction of Students in Advanced Courses}

\label{sec:teaching_phil2}

\textit{Physics majors} are the second category of students we encounter, and I broaden the category to computer science because I also teach advanced COSC courses.  In my time at Whittier College, I have created two upper-division computer science courses that are part of every engineering/computer science curriculum in schools similar to Whittier College, but were not being offered here.  The first was PHYS306/COSC330, Computer Logic and Digital Circuit Design, and COSC390, Digital Signal Processing.  For sample curricula demonstrating the widespread adoption of these courses in schools like Whittier College, see \cite{BiolaCR} \cite{LMUCR}.  The syllabi for these courses are included in the Supplemental Material.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Three focuses are relevant for teaching physics, mathematics, and computer science majors at the advanced level:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mental Discipline}.  Advanced physics, math and computer science courses require mental discipline.  The professor must foster this value in the students in two ways.  First, the students need a professional curriculum that requires them to think \textit{analytically} and \textit{creatively}.  Second, the professor should demonstrate \textit{expertise} and the ability to lead students by example.  For example, in COSC390 (Digital Signal Processing) I wrote example code in MATLAB to demonstrate concepts from class, and the students downloaded and modified it to suit their purposes for individual projects.  I summarize mental discipline into two goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Challenge the students with course content that requires both analytic and creative thinking (questions 11 and 20 from the evaluation)
\item Provide the students with technical expertise and guidance (questions 12 and 19 from the evaluation)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Strength in all Phases of Science}. Advanced course curriculum in physics, math, and computer science must include the following \textit{phases} of scientific activity: abstract problem solving, numerical modeling/prediction, experimental design and execution, and data analysis. I therefore have four specific goals in this area, corresponding to the four areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Measurably strengthen the abstract problem solving of the students (question 14 from evaluation)
\item Expose students to numerical modeling with computer code  %Examples, GitHub of DSP
\item Assist the students with the design and execution of technical projects %Examples: presentations from COSC330/390
\item Strengthen the data analysis abilities of the students %Examples: presentations from COSC330/390
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Communication}.  A critical skill in technical fields is oral and written communication.  Whittier College graduates in the fields of physics, mathematics, and computer science should be able to communicate technical ideas to their peers.  Clear communication in engineering and scientific research contexts prevents design flaws and misconceptions.  I require the students to submit a longer paper and/or presentation in each advanced course, with the goal of improvement of their technical communication.  To this end, I set two goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Require the students to submit at least one major written or oral assignment %Examples
\item Provide students the opportunity to refine the work in office hours before submission %Show the rubric which states they must show me the proposal
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Department-Level Goals}

The Department of Physics and Astronomy has eight goals, developed as part of our 5-year assessment cycle. In the coming course descriptions, these goals will be referenced.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Develop and offer a wide range of physics courses using the most effective pedagogical methods and styles.  Such courses shall include appropriate contributions to the Liberal Education Program (currently COM1 and CON2).
\item Create research experiences for physics majors that will engage and inspire them in their discovery of physics.
\item Build a departmental community that is supportive and welcoming and that encourages students in their studies of physics.
\item Keep the physics curriculum current so that students gain the skills necessary for success in today’s scientific environment.
\item Teach students how to teach themselves. Give them the intellectual tools necessary for independent thinking and learning.
\item Train students to think ``scientifically'' i.e. critically, rigorously, quantitatively, and objectively, so that they can analyze problems and generate solutions.
\item Train students to effectively communicate scientific ideas to others.
\item Advise students about various career paths and help them along these paths.
\end{enumerate}
