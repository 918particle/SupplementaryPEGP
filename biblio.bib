  abstract = {The ARIANNA hexagonal radio array (HRA) is an experiment in its pilot phase designed to detect cosmogenic neutrinos of energies above 10^16 eV. The most neutrino-like background stems from the radio emission of air showers. This article reports on dedicated efforts of simulating and detecting the signals of cosmic rays. A description of the fully radio self-triggered data-set, the properties of the detected air shower signals in the frequency range of \unit[100-500]{MHz} and the consequences for neutrino detection are given. 38 air shower signals are identified by their distinct waveform characteristics, are in good agreement with simulations and their signals provide evidence that neutrino-induced radio signals will be distinguishable with high efficiency in ARIANNA. The cosmic ray flux at a mean energy of $6.5^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\times10^{17}$ eV is measured to be $1.1^{+1.0}_{-0.7}\times10^{-16}$ eV$^{-1}$km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$yr$^{-1}$ and one five-fold coincident event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the ARIANNA detector to reconstruct arrival direction and energy of air showers.}

  abstract = {Neutrinos are key to probing the deep structure of matter and the high-energy Universe. Yet, until recently, their interactions had only been measured at laboratory energies up to about 350 GeV. An opportunity to measure their interactions at higher energies opened up with the detection of high-energy neutrinos in IceCube, partially of astrophysical origin. Scattering off matter inside the Earth affects the distribution of their arrival directions --- from this, we extract the neutrino-nucleon cross section at energies from 18 TeV to 2 PeV, in four energy bins, in spite of uncertainties in the neutrino flux. Using six years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we explicitly show for the first time that the energy dependence of the cross section above 18 TeV agrees with the predicted softer-than-linear dependence, and reaffirm the absence of new physics that would make the cross section rise sharply, up to a center-of-mass energy of ~1 TeV.},

We also present the associated uncertainties propagated from the PDFs, as well as parametrizations of the cross section central values, their uncertainty bounds, and the inelasticity distributions for ease of use in Monte Carlo simulations. For the latter we only provide parametrizations for energies above 107 GeV. Finally, we assess the feasibility of future neutrino experiments to constrain the νN cross section in the ultrahigh energy regime using a technique that is independent of the flux spectrum of incident neutrinos. A significant deviation from the predicted standard model cross sections could be an indication of new physics, such as extra space-time dimensions, and we present expected constraints on such models as a function of the number of events observed in a future subterranean neutrino detector.}

  abstract = {We present 88 multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images (most at an observing frequency of 8 GHz), of 20 TeV blazars, all of the HBL class, that have not been previously studied at multiple epochs on the parsec scale. From these 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components that are all detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the apparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of the components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within two-sigma) with no motion; and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition, a superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is detected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a two-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to analyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have been studied with VLBI at multiple epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the parsec-scale radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates obtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent speed data for the TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine and a slower outer layer.}
